# Lighting

![Demo](./demo.gif)

# Time

1 hour to reach the basic assignment requirements.
Spent ~3ish hours educating myself on shaders. Once I understood the 
pixel lighting shader code from ex25, I took the implementation to enable
more smooth lighting for my low-vertex objects.

# Usage and Build

*arrow keys* to orbit.  
Use `make` to build and `./scene3d` to run. Or, `make run`.
