# Time

- Spent about 30m making sure I properly understood depth buffering.
- 1 hour implementing my own 3d geometry library.
- 4 hours finding a bug introducing garbage values into the program
because I misunderstood $(i + 1 ~~\%~~ n)$ as $(i + 1) ~~\%~~ n$ when
it is actually $i + (1 ~~\%~~ n)$.
- Another 2ish hours on the geometry library.
